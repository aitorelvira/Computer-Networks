-Project name: TCP Sockets Programming Assignment. Basic TCP Message App
-Project description: this project was about to make a TCP Client/Server Message App
where more than one client could connect simultaneously to the server (using multithreading)
-Project purpose: getting used to programming TCP in python.
-Instructions:
	-First, clone the repository.
	-Second, execute: "python server.py"
	-Third, execute: "python clien.py"
		-This will ask to introduce:
			-IP address-> introduce: 'localhost'
			-Port-> introduce: '9999'
			-Name-> introduce whatever name
-The python version used in this project is python 3.
-Challenges in this project:
	-First of all, this is the first time I used python, so it was challenging for me to get used
	to this language.
	-Then, I achieved to do a connection between client and server, but I did not get the multithreading
	part. When I tried to connect another client to the server, it just kept waiting to connect, it waited
	to the current client to disconnect from the server. The control of the program stayed at the thread, so
	it never came back to the server until the client pressed 6. I understood the proper way to do it but I 
	have not been able to program it.
-My conclusion for this project is that I have learnt a lot of new things for me such as programming in python and TCP 
client/server, even though I could not make it that well in the code. I ran out of time to finish it, so I am a little 
bit disappointed, but I will try to finish it in the future.
